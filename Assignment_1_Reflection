I felt extremely well about the instructional document. I felt that I picked a topic that I was very knowlegeable about. I thought that my audience fit my topic at first. However, as I started writing, I had to narrow my audience down so that my intructions would fit my audience and were easly understandable. I felt that I had a good topic but it may have been a bit to complex. the complexity of my topic give me fits while I was writing. My only woory is that my instuctions wasn't organized and clear enough to follow and understand. 
I Liked the peer reveiws that helped me alot. I like the freedom to write about what we wanted. That helped me write with some confidence.
