#Processing a Hog

For my instructional documnet I have chose to give instructions on how to properly process a hog. My auidence will be people that work in the butchering business but need traing and are non PETA supporters. My auidence will also have some experience with the equipment used in the processing facility. I assume that my auidence understands the reason and prurpose for processing hogs, so I will avoid giving to much detail about the purose. I want to explain the process in a simple yet meaningful way. My paper will be outlined in a step by step format.
