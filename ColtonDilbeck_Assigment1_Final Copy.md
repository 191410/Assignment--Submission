## Introduction

### The Purpose of the Instructions

This instructional document was designed to teach people recently hired in butchering or processing facilities. This document explains how to process a pig into wholesale cuts. The instructions assume that the new hires have already completed a training on wholesale cuts. In addition, the new hires have completed equipment safety training. The instructions are set up in a step-by-step format. It is important that you read the entire step before starting the task. The document will walk you trough the process while you are practicing and getting hands on training. In addition to breaking down the steps, the instructions also explain the importance of following the step-by-step procedure and illustrates what the end product for each step should look like.

### Background Information

Processing a hog into wholesale cuts is an important trade that a butcher most learn. In order to make money for the business and keep a job as a butcher, one must be able to process a pig into the four main wholesale cuts. The four wholesale cuts are ham, loin, shoulder, and side (belly). The purpose for processing pigs is to make money and the eat of course; however, if you can't produce an end product that satisfies the costumer or dosen't taste good, then you are hurting the value of the business. Hogs are processed in a particular order or manner because certain cuts of the pig are of higher value to consumers. Consumer's may prefer one particular cut of meat over the other; therefore, a butcher must know and understand where that cut of meat comes from and the steps that he must take in order to provide the preferred cut. Following the steps and instructions will also help reduce mistakes. These steps must be followed in this particular order to prevent parts of the pig from being mis-cut. Making a wrong cut could degrade the value of the meat.

### Supplies Needed

- Boning Knife
- Bone Saw
- Electric Saw (Optional)
- Cutting Table
- Half a Hog

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Removing the Front Shoulder

Start the process with half a pig lying flat on the cutting table with the feet facing you. Move to the front quarter of the pig. Find the first rib and count back three ribs. Visualize a straight line in between the third and fourth rib that extends from the top of the pig down into its armpit area. Take the saw of your choice and cut in a straight line in between the third and fourth rib. The spine should be the only bone that you have to saw through. The shoulder should now be detached. This picture illustrates how the end product should look. 

### Step 2: Removal of the Ham

Next move to the hind quarter of the pig. Take two fingers and place next to the split pelvic bone. A two fingers width is about two inches away from the pelvic bone. Visual a straight line from the outside edge of your finger. The line your visualizing should extend from the hogs back down to the flank (where the ham and belly connect on the underside of the hog). Next take the boning or electric saw and cut straight down that visual line and all the way through the carcass. The ham should now be detached from the remainder of the pig. This picture illustrates how the end product should look.

### Step 3: Separating of the Loin from the Side

Next move to the end of pig where the shoulder of the pig was detached. Position yourself so that you can see the meat that lies under the ribs and spine. Near the pigs back and underneath the spine you should see a round muscle that is lighter in color. This muscle runs down the entire length of the pigs back and is referred to as the loin. That loin muscle gets thicker the closer it gets to the ham. Grab the bone saw and start sawing approximately 1/2 an inch from the loin muscle. Keep working your way down the rib bones with the bone saw and make sure that you stay a 1/2 inch from the loin. The outer edge of the loin muscle serves as guide for splitting the hog side into an upper and lower portion. As you cut down the side remember the loin muscle gets thicker the closer you get to the ham. This picture illustrates how the end product should look.

### Step 4: Remove the Lower Ribs from the Belly

Last, take your boning knife and cut in between the ribs and the belly. Keep your knife blade angled up to avoid cutting into the bacon. Keep cutting until the entire lower section of the ribs is removed from the belly. This picture illustrates how the end product should look.
