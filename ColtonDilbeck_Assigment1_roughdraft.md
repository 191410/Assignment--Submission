## Some Basic Knowledge and Terminology
A buthcher most unnderstand the four major sections of the hog. These sections include the ham, loin, side (bacon), and shoulder. Before one can undertand where particular cuts come form on a hog they must undertand which area the cut of meat is coming from on the hog (picture the full hog divided into four sections). Certain parts of a hog are prepaired differnetly once again depending on the consumers preferences. The ham and side are two areas of the hog that require further preration know as smoking. Smoking is the process of using smoke and heat created from burning wood chunks to heat treat the meat. A ham is usally fully cooked to a temperature of 158 degrees fahrenheit. The hog side is only heat treated or smoked to around 140 degrees fahrenheit. Hams are typically broken down and sold as a whole or half half ham, ham steak, or a small protion know as the ham hock (the section of the rear leg just right above the bend). The side of the hog is divided into two sections the loin which is the top half and the side which is the bottom half. The major coponetnt that make up the top half or loin section are the sirloin, upper rib section, outer loin, and tenderloin. This is the section where the  loin and rib chops are cut form (commonly know as pork chops). The bottom half of the side contains the spare ribs (lower portion of the ribs) and the fresh side or bacon area. The last section is the shoulder. The shoulder is seperated out into the boston butt, picnic, and hock. The boston butt in top half of the shoulder, the pinic makes up the bottom third of the shoulder, and the hock once again the the portion that extends from the knee up (only two to four inches above the knee).
